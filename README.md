# Competitive

A number of solutions for various competitive programming tasks.
The solutions are in Java.

The solutions presented weren't written in the real-time setting.
The aim was to practice solving classic algorithmic problems
and reach a higher insight, not bragging rights. For that reason
the solutions might feature lengthy JavaDocs explaining the solution,
its code structure and algorithms involved.

Additionally, Java core language features were put to test.

## Running the code

The online judges restrict solutions to a single file per solution.
Therefore there is no inter-file structure of any kind and the code
is just an Eclipse project with a bunch of files. The only structure
is by the task origin. Any particular solution can be run in Eclipse
by pressing Alt+Shift+X, J with the solution Java file focused.

Note that while the classes are placed in packages, the online judges
don't support it, so sending the solution would require deleting the
package declaration line.

JDK 21 was used, but not necessarily its newest features.

Supplementary code for one of the tasks requires the SWT project opened
in Eclipse.
See the [official instructions](https://www.eclipse.org/swt/eclipse.php)
on setting up that project.

## License

There is nothing cutting-edge in the code, therefore I consider it public domain.

You're free to use this code any way you want.
